# Test the string interpolation feature
# Similar to Python's f-strings but using () instead of {}

# Define some variables
(let name "Onion")
(let age 1)
(let pi 3.14159)
(let is_cool true)
(let numbers (list 1 2 3 4 5))

# Simple string interpolation with a single variable
(print f"Programming language: (name)")

# Multiple variables in a string
(print f"(name) is (age) year old and has value of pi = (pi)")

# Boolean values
(print f"Is (name) cool? (is_cool)!")

# With list values
(let first (id 0 numbers))
(print f"The first number is (first) and the length is (len numbers)")

# Numbers and arithmetic
(let x 10)
(let y 20)
(print f"x = (x) and y = (y)")

# Trying to use a non-existent variable
(print f"This will cause an error: (non_existent_var)")
